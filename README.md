# Powerball_Greenphire for Python 3.X
Powerball project for Greenphire

Author: Justin MacIntosh

A project designed to emulate employees working together to determine which numbers they will invest in purchasing for Powerball based on each of their own personal favorite numbers.

Each User enters his/her name into the program, and then picks 5 regular numbers and one Powerball number. Each User does this in turn, making sure not to duplicate their own non-Powerball numbers, and after each User has finished the results are computed. The most popular numbers for each category are chosen as the final result, with a random number being chosen if there is ever a tie for most popular.

Each non-Powerball number has a range of range 1-69, while Powerball numbers have a range of 1-26. The Powerball is the 6th number. These values can be edited in the globals.
